# JAN 26 - CHAPTER 1 - THE COMMODITY

PREFACE: Individuals in the economic society are bearers of socio-economic categories; behavior that economic structure rewards are required for it to function, and the individual is the creator and subject of relations.

COMMODITY:
- satisfies the human need of some sort (doesn't need to be basic);
- embodies human labor;
- commodities exist in a network of exchange;
- basic elementary block of capitalism;
- not meant to be utilized by the producer of it, expressively meant to be exchanged.

USE-VALUE:
- satisfies some human need, qualitative, embodied in its physical being;
- a key building block of wealth (differentiated from value);
- inherently qualitative;
- doesn't have to be mediated by labor.

EXCHANGE-VALUE:
- the quantitive relation that one use-value exchanges for another;
- not inherent in commodities, external to it, and appears when commodities are compared;
- makes commodities equal, or comparable;
- bond to time and place "accidental";
- the language of commodities;
- an external expression of the labor in commodities;
- a form of appearance, hidden and doesn't show its face;
- requires commensurability
- commensurability comes from the common grand of labor in the abstract.

VALUE:
- socially necessary labor time embodied in the commodity;
- dynamic, based on social conditions of production in a given matter;
- more labor -> greater value;
- commodities that can be produced in the same amount of time have the same value;
- there can be use-values that are not values!

VALUE-FORM:
- value makes appearance when A/s only compared with other commodities;
- the Equitas show how value is immaterial, but objective;
- only in the exchange relation does the exchange value exist;
- the logical origin of the money form

In capitalism, use-values are produced for exchange-subordinates use-value.

Dual characteristic of labor:
1. CONCRETE LABOR
- useful labor
- qualitative
2. ABSTRACT LABOR
- abstracted from useful, qualitative aspects of labor;
- equal exchange values are the product of equal labor time.

WEALTH vs. VALUE:
- Wealth: the amount of use-value; useful labor produces wealth.
- Value: connected to abstract labor time; abstracted labor.

RELATIVE VALUE - the value of what is expressed as a commodity.
EQUIVALENT VALUE - the commodity compared to the relative value to provide the exchange value of the relative value. 
- only in equivalence is exchange value apparent and disappears without equivalent;
- the value comes out as commodities are compared with one another;
- Marx calls it a language, a communication mirror;
- build subjectivity through confrontation with other commodities.

MONEY is purely an equivalence.

FETISHISM: 
- a secret that behind the commodity is labor;
- social characteristics of human labor appear as objective aspects of things;
- reification of social relations to commodity relations;
- makes conditions of capitalism appear natural;
- the physical manifestation of labor mediates the appearance of a thing as a commodity;
- the language of commodities is the language of Fetishism.

# FEBRUARY 9 - CHAPTER 2 - THE PROCESS OF EXCHANGE

EXCHANGE:
- not only the economic transactions but social relations;
- there is a social interpretation of Marx as an economic determinist
even though he was accused of being a reductionist, as in his interpretation of economic base (i.e. culture, politics, religion) derives from the material relation which delimits the certain range of the economic base's superstructure. 
- economics relations contain many facets that express themselves on further levels.
- personification of economic categories.

HOT TAKES from Chapter 2:
1. The commodity that is exchanged must bring use value;
2. A commodity must realize its value before its use values;
3. Money necessarily crystallizes from the process of exchange.

Once you develop a universal commodity exchange situation and somehow it becomes out of people's control (hello, capitalism!), then the EXCHANGE-VALUE comes and dominates the USE-VALUE. This determines what you can produce and how you produce it (let's say you want your product to make money on the market - you have to adapt it then); and while such a process can be a sum of many different productions, it still escapes the control of any producer. 

# FEBRUARY 9 - CHAPTER 3 - MONEY, OR THE CIRCULATION OF COMMODITIES

Chapter 3 conveys the theory of money and gives you a glimpse of Marx's larger project. In this chapter, Marx lists different aspects of money in the commodity economy, but for Marx the functions that money plays are not complimentary - they contradict each other, showing that the world of money is inherently contradictory.

PRICE:
- not a material substance, its an abstraction, its a label or notion;
- a language that develops with commodity exchange for commodities to communicate;
- convey meaning and give us information.

MONEY:
- a measure of value, but also a standard of PRICE;
- value is not identical to price, as these concepts are related while not being the same thing; 
- PRICE hides VALUES! 
- and price differs quantitive from value! <- 

^ The two last statements are the most important points from a politically economic perspective.

FUNCTIONS OF MONEY:
1. The measure of values (i.e. money in that function replaces commodity in exchange and represents commodity in the exchange process, assuming the form of commodity);
2. Means of circulation (Marx's concept of metamorphosis: from particular to universal, from commodity to a universal form).


Money constantly creates new needs, so needs are not fixed and accelerated through innovations. The division of labor is an organization of production.

C-M-C (COMMODITY-MONEY-COMMODITY):
- the dynamics of social interaction that emerge from the mechanism of labor and impersonal domination. It creates the dialectics of independence, meaning that we are independent, but also dependent on that system of commodities and money as producers. The necessary logic of commodity exchange gives the drive to the mechanism of power.
- a moment of money is a movement from a particular commodity to universal abstraction - but also a negation of skillful expenses of human power, and useful labor. The economic system negates concrete aspects of human labor, money hides and obscures and conceals the true nature of human labor, hides the vast diversity of human skills, and homogenizes human qualities.
- the fact that money can be exchanged for everything gives the owner unlimited power; someone who has money can validate any activities and lackings.

EXCHANGE develops into CIRCULATION:
- Circulation that process exceeds the agency or control of agents;
- Say's Law is the building block of neoclassical economics - every sale is a purchase, and every purchase is a sale. Therefore, circulation is a balanced stable process between sales and purchases;
- the disconnect between price and value cannot manifest itself (typical crisis of overproduction).

So, how much money should be in circulation, and what determines the quantity of money in the economy? In Marx's terms, we question:

- velocity of money (speed of transactions);
- quantity of commodities in circulation;
- the sum of prices of commodities in circulation (p. 219);
- the sum of payments and debts.

Price determines the quantity of money, not the opposite.

Hoarding money becomes the money of a private person instead of social power (p. 231). The notion of limitless accumulation of money (hoarding drive) is limitless, being a form of accumulation of social power, first time in history based not on military power, but on this abstract notion of money.

The buyer becomes the debtor - they both emerge from commodity circulations; buyer and seller become a power relation - creditor and debtor. 

The concept of a commodity brought by Marx elegantly emerges all these ideas starting with USE-VALUES and wrapping up with debters and creditors.

# FEBRUARY 23 - CHAPTER 4 - THE GENERAL FORMULA FOR CAPITAL

Given that C-M-C is the direct form of the circulation of commodities (selling to buy), we understand its purpose as the generation of USE-VALUE (i.e. satisfaction of needs), and exchange happens between commodities of equal VALUES and qualitatively different USE-VALUES (i.e. exchange of corn for clothes).  

However, in the inverted form of this formula, M-C-M (buying to sell), money is exchanged for money, and given that there are no qualitatively different USE-VALUES in money, the complete formula would be M-C-M', where M and M' are quantitatively different amounts of money, which generates EXCHANGE-VALUE, or, more precisely, considering that M'= M + M_delta, the formula creates SURPLUS-VALUE, an increment over the original value. 

SURPLUS-VALUE is VALORIZED (SELF-VALORIZED) VALUE, meaning that value itself becomes the subject (p.252). "Value becomes value in the process, money in the process, and, as such, capital" (p.256). "M-C-M' is the general formula for capital, in the form in which it appears directly in the sphere of circulation" (p.257).

# FEBRUARY 23 - CHAPTER 5 - CONTRADICTIONS IN THE GENERAL FORMULA

This chapter analyzes circulation from all angles and perspectives, arguing that the circulation CAN NOT create SURPLUS-VALUE, so the commerce based on the circulation of commodities cannot create growth (see Adam Smith) simply because the exchange on equivalences does never add surplus (p.266). When commodities are not bought at their value or not sold at their value, it is logically supposed to be always someone's loss and a zero-sum game.

However, if surplus does not come from circulation, then where does it come from? The answer is LABOUR POWER (p.266). The SURPLUS-VALUE, or M' in the M-C-M' formula, is, therefore, the labor power - so labor power originates from commodity, and not from money.

# FEBRUARY 23 - CHAPTER 6 - THE SALE AND PURCHASE OF LABOUR-POWER

LABOUR-POWER is the aggregate of a human's physical and mental capabilities needed to produce USE-VALUE (p.270). For most historical development, labor power was not available on the market as a commodity, and human expenditure was never meant to be sold as a commodity on the market. And which is also not meant to be generalized - but if it is not generalized, then it cannot be submitted to a commodity market. But, by entering the commodity market with labor power, you now have to buy and sell things (i.e. your labor) on the market to survive; you don't access the necessities (food and housing) if you don't enter the market transactions.  

If LABOUR-POWER is a commodity, then it should have value, use-value, and exchange-value just as other commodities:
- USE-VALUE: it is a property of creating VALUE (p.271); moreover, LABOUR-POWER needs to create not only value but more value than its costs, so its USE-VALUE is superior to its EXCHANGE-VALUE. In other words, this commodity, being put on the market, generates more value the more you consume it!
- VALUE: capitalism cannot produce labor-power, so it has to find it on the market, which means there is someone that has to REPRODUCE. Therefore, the value of labor power becomes the sum of goods needed for the reproduction of labor power (daily human necessities). So, the VALUE of labor-power is the social time needed to produce necessities (p.275-276 and social reproduction theories).
- EXCHANGE-VALUE is the WAGE - the actual price you sell your labor power for (note that price here isn't equal to value as well - see Chapter 2). Marx makes a separation between labor and wage - you advance the value of your work, and then you get the wage for it after the work is done (p.278). 

[p.279-p.280 are one of the most important pages in the book]

# FEBRUARY 23 - CHAPTER 7 - THE LABOUR PROCESS AND THE VALORIZATION PROCESS

We are going from philosophical arguments to a more specific historical context (p.291), considering the concept of labor as metabolism between human and nature, as their intrinsic relation through the prism of labor (p.283, ecological Marxism). Ontologically, labor is the first reality and there is no human (or no world) without labor. Human labor - in terms of differentiating between humans and animals - is specified by purposeful will, by conscious will which precedes the labor (unlike bees or ants, for example).

Therefore, we define the LABOR PROCESS through:
- purposeful activity
- the object on which activity is performed, or RAW MATERIAL - the object of labor which has been achieved through previous labor (i.e. cotton) 
- instruments of labor - thing that mediates purposeful activity and the object of labor (i.e. hammer) (p.284).

From the perspective of instruments, Marx differentiates between dead labor and living labor. DEAD LABOR is the labor that has been congealed in the object, so the temporality over the object is over. To extract the value of dead labor (the means of production), you need actual living labor. For example, machines (dead labor) do not create new value by themselves - only LIVING LABOR adds value to it.

The capital reshapes the labor process, takes over it, and turns it into VALORIZATION to create SURPLUS-VALUE:
- capital decides what and how it should be produced - you do what you are told at work;
- capital gets to keep the product of labor, so you do not own what you create and you lose the purpose of your activity;
- capital owns the value, so the labor process becomes the process between humans and commodities that the capitalist owns (on top of giving up surplus value, you also give up the value of your labor).

In a non-capitalist setting, the original aim of the labor process is to create value and use value. When capitalist buys the labor process, they aim to produce not only a use-value but a commodity; not only value but surplus-value (p.293). In other terms, the use-value produced by capitalists is SYSTEMATICALLY GREATER than the labor power. Capitalist gives the worker part of his labor in the form of a wage, but most of that labor goes to the pocket of capitalists. Once again, labor-power, being commodified, creates more power when you consume it. Capitalist wants the production of absolute surplus value through the mechanism of systematical exploitation. When the labor process is owned by the capitalist, there is always disproportion, it's never equal.

# FEBRUARY 23 - CHAPTER 8 - CONSTANT CAPITAL AND VARIABLE CAPITAL

VARIABLE CAPITAL is the capital that adds new value. The key idea of the chapter is the idea of transfer of value (i.e. what happens to value in the production process) - while this value gets transferred from means of production to new commodities, the value of constant capital gets transferred to new products.

Dead labor is necessitated by living labor, it is preserved and transferred into commodities through living labor. Abstract labor adds new value, but concrete labor preserves and transfers. This value is material (but objective), but the means of dead labor (machine production) NEVER creates value, as the value is always transferred by LIVING LABOR. Labor not only produces value, but it preserves the value stored by the capitalist. IF WE STOP WORKING then CAPITALISTS LOSE THEIR POWER.

# MARCH 8 - CHAPTER 10 - THE WORKING DAY

The working day is a construct; the working day has no inherent limits (as they are elastic), but two forms of determinable limits can exist (p.341):

1. Physical limits: how much labor the human body can perform.
2. Moral limits: laws, norms, and regulations - the result of class struggle and the relation between classes.

The length of a working day fluctuates between boundaries physical and social (p. 341); however, the length of the working day is defined by the capitalist (bearer of the capital) and the worker / the level of exchange (level of circulation of commodities - see Chapters 2-3). Both workers and capitalists have the same right to determine the length of the working day. So the working day is a temporal category - which itself is a space / locus for social struggle. While capitalism predates the working day, the laws and regulations try to define the social balance of power. 

So there is a force between these two equal sides (p. 344). To Marx, the force is coercion through politics and influence through legislation. The class which will be able to influence the political process, will then get to represent its interests - unions represent workers, while political parties represent the interests of capital. Marx is skeptical about bourgeois law, but he doesn't discard the legitimacy of a political process. Workers they matter. Classes fight for definitions of laws and norms.

Voracious appetite! Forms of exploitation existed in different modes of production (slavery, feudalism - as Marx brings examples in Section 2 of the chapter), but in capitalism it becomes more obscure, and less clear, hiding itself behind WAGES. All these forms of appropriation at least let you know where and when you have been exploited (i.e. corvee), so you know where is the SURPLUS. In capitalism, though, exploitation is intricate in the working day - so it mixes surplus labor and necessary labor in the same workday.

There are similarities between slave labor and wage labor, though:

1. If the number of workers (population of workers) is constant, then the capitalist is interested in keeping them healthy.
2. Otherwise, it becomes important for the capitalist to get to the markets of workers. Resembling slavery at the slave trade times, capitalism is craving legislation that will allow the migration of workers so the market is properly supplied (p.380). You can work your workers to death if the system provides more workers.

Time as well as a social phenomenon and a space for power - __temporal struggle__.  Clocks create a form of time that is abstract, and homogeneous - so you need equal time units to make more work at the same time, to be more productive, and, therefore, the appetite for surplus labor in fact can be seen as the appetite for time (p.352); *exploitation takes the form of time*. 

Furthest sections of the chapter cover other aspects of the working day; Section 3 raises questions about health and safety issues as well as the consequences of repetitive tasks on the human body, while Section 4 elaborates on shift system and night shifts - night work exists to maximize surplus and minimize idle time as much as possible (p. 367). Time imperative is a strong concept for Marx in terms of transferring value to machines, meaning that the capitalist needs to get the value out of machines (and means of production) constantly.

p. 375 has a very famous quote all the way down to the first lines of p. 377

p. 382 (see also: Michel Foucault) - surveillance, discipline, organizing human behavior.

p. 391 brings up a discussion on capitalist anthropology in terms of negotiation and definition of the childhood's end (i.e. time when the capitalist can finally start employing man's power), and here we go again to re-defining temporal categories (workday, time, childhood, maturity) as social constructs.

# MARCH 8 - CHAPTER 11 - THE RATE AND MASS OF SURPLUS-VALUE

There are three laws of absolute surplus value:

1. The mass of surplus value produced is equal to the amount of variable capital advanced multiplied by the rate of surplus value (p. 418). 
2. The absolute limit of the average working day sets an absolute limit to the compensation for a reduction of variable capital by a higher rate of surplus value, or for the decrease of the number of workers exploited by a higher degree of exploitation of labor-power (p. 419).  
3. With a given rate of surplus value, and given value of labor-power, therefore, the masses of surplus value produced vary directly as the amounts of the variable capital advanced (p. 420).

The masses of value and surplus-value produced by different capitals <...> very directly as the amounts of the variable components of these capitals (p. 421). Hence, the mass of value varies in functions of proportion of labor power (because it is the labor that produces it). There is no point in exploitation 1 person to death if you can exploit 100 people. 

CAPITALIST TAKEOVER OF LABOR PROCESS is a very important point in the end of the chapter, formulated in 2 steps:

1. Formal subsension of labor under capital (meaning that cotton plantations are linked to the north Atlantic market and producing raw materials for capitalists and fabrics in England; capitalists formerly subsume the labor, but production of cotton is not the capitalist).

2. As the valorization of labor happens, then there is an INVERSION between dead labor and living labor; in a non-capitalist society labor process the living labor uses the dead labor (we use tools to make things), but in capitalism, dead labor becomes the capital.
 
# MARCH 15 - CHAPTER 12 - THE CONCEPT OF RELATIVE SURPLUS VALUE

So, if the capitalist wants to maximize the surplus value, then they can maximize the length of the work day. That would be called *absolute surplus value*. However, from previous chapters, we know that the work day besides the surplus-value labor (the labor that produces surplus value) also contains necessary labor. And if the length of the working day is limited, then the capitalist can make socially necessary labor shorter. That's how the *relative surplus value* is produced (p. 432).

Necessary labor here essentially refers to the basket of goods (i.e. necessities needed to support the worker's life); reducing the amount of necessary labor therefore refers to decreasing the value of the necessary goods. Cheaper clothes, cheaper food, cheaper housing - reducing costs for producing these goods can be achieved through increased productivity of labor, or through the MACHINES (which are more productive and so lower the total value) - and these goods transfer their value to another sector to reduce the costs. Things are cheaper, the worker needs less time to do less work to cover the necessary labor, and hence the worker can get faster to the surplus value labor, given the same working day. 

So, keeping basic goods and necessities cheaper is advantageous both for workers and for THE CAPITAL. The state's regulations and authority mechanisms also take place - basic food items, for example, are usually not a subject of taxation; supply chains strive to import cheap foods/goods from abroad (Walmart, Costco, Amazon), from places in the world where labor is cheaper.

Marx, however, distinguishes between the concept of SOCIAL SURPLUS VALUE and INDIVIDUAL SURPLUS VALUE. In the case of individual surplus value, capital pockets extra relative surplus value due to innovation (p.344-345); the incentive for innovation and scientific development becomes the function of the free market in capitalism (just like science funded by firms and by governments - the science which has the market outcome). With these mechanisms, there is no last stage of productivity - there is always endless growth, always the appetite to get more and produce more (p. 346-347). Capitalists always have to outcompete and overproduce. 

# MARCH 15 - CHAPTER 13 - CO-OPERATION

Under capitalism, the productive power of cooperation becomes a tool for a capitalist. Even though the capitalist pays each worker individually, cooperatively the workers produce more than they are paid for (through the power of cooperation);  let's say the capitalist pays each of 15 workers individually, but 15 the workers co-operating produce more surplus value than 15 workers would produce if they were to work individually.

The product of collective labor appears as a product of the capital. The workers are isolated even though they work together (p. 448). The power of labor - even though the capital took over it...

# MARCH 15 - CHAPTER 14 - THE DIVISION OF LABOR AND MANUFACTURE

Division of labor and manufacturing for Marx is also a form of production of relative surplus value. The guiding thread is similar to what was brought up in the previous chapters - there are trends in the historical practice of the division of labor in society, but they are re-organized by capitalists to generate capital. Adam Smith (classical political economy) assumes the progressing concept of division of labor (from historic ways to manufacturing), but for Marx, these are two distinct forms: there is a natural division of labor in society, and there is also a division of labor in manufacturing.

The traditional division of labor in society was based on individual artisans and the commodity exchange between them. Productization in the hands of the capitalist, though, creates a space to produce labor power and surplus value - by manufacturing, by reorganizing spacial and temporal coordinates of production. 

Also, we want to distinguish between heterogeneous (different parts are produced and assembled as a hole - like the iPhone) and organic (the development of a single object passed through a chain of labor, one material goes through a series of assemblages) division of labor. While in both examples workers become in a way parts of PRODUCTIVE MECHANISM (one big operation), in the latter case (how it used to be) humans use tools to produce things, and in the former case, tools use humans to produce things. So, capitalism imposes the separation of tasks in more precise operations, so the workers specialize and the tools specialize to increase productivity. Just like in Darwin's natural selection theory, only the most adaptive ones survive. In manufacturing the provision of a given quantity of the product in a given period of labor is a technical law of the process of production itself (p. 465).

Producers come under the capitalist power, so we observe the deskilling of labor (compare cashiers nowadays with artisans hundreds of years ago). If labor is less skilled, then it costs less to reproduce (p. 481-482). Anarchy and competition organize the market, but planning and despotism organize the workplace; the worker is reduced to a one-trick pony, and the human is reduced to an unautonomous, alienated, faceless subject of the capital.

# MARCH 22 - CHAPTER 15 - MACHINERY AND LARGE-SCALE INDUSTRY

We continue to analyze different ways to produce surplus value; during Marx's times, mechanization and the industrial revolution were fully fledged, and we focus on machinery which started to take over, as it brought up a shift in the usage of tools and a reversal in technology as the tool not wielded by the same agent or the same force (p. 493). "The machine, which is the starting point of the industrial revolution, replaces the worker, who handles a single tool, by a mechanism operating with several similar tools and set in motion by a single motive power, whatever the form of that power" (p. 497). In a mechanized society, man becomes disposable - humans used to produce things with tools, and now machines produce things with humans.

p. 493 contains one of the most interesting footnotes in the whole book, which elaborates on how machinery exists in capitalism. As Marx writes in this footnote, "technology reveals the active relation of man to nature, the direct process of the production of his life, and thereby it also lays bare the process of the production of the social relations of his life, and of the mental conceptions that flow from these relations". Seeing technology as the productive organs of man in society from a Darwinist perspective, we can notice that while technology mediates labor, we open up a world that capitalism produces with technology (urban world, digital world, globalized world, and many other social temporalities accelerated by technologies in many ways); technology reveals to man many new worlds (just like microscope unfolds the cellular level of things while the telescope allows us to observe the space and other realms beyond the human eye) which are still a part of a capitalist process.

"A system of machinery, whether it is based simply on the co-operation of similar machines, as in weaving, or on a combination of different machines, as in spinning, constitutes in itself a vast automaton as soon as it is driven by a self-acting prime mover" (p. 502). "An organized system of machines to which motion is communicated by the transmitting mechanism from an automatic center is the most developed form of production by machinery" (p. 503). "The transformation of the mode of production in one sphere of industry necessitates a similar transformation in other spheres" (p. 505) So, as the system is based is based cooperation of machines, machines start to call for more machines, and machines production is applied to machines themselves, "a mechanical monster whose body fills whole factories" - machines produce machines, and the capital starts to create its own technical foundations, alienating the labor process itself.  

Section 2 of the chapter reiterates the argument on dead labor in the context of machinery transferring the value of means of production (i.e. living labor) to constant capital - machines, as any dead labor, do not create value - "machinery, like every other component of constant capital, creates no new value, but yields up its own value to the product it serves to beget" (p. 509).

There is much more socially necessary labor time in a machine than, say, in a hammer. Therefore the machine can transfer quantitatively more value to the product, meaning that the machinery in capitalism is labor-saving and designed to increase productivity. Capitalism mechanizes production to save labor; more relative surplus-value - less labor to make more goods! A machine has to congeal more labor than was needed to create a machine (otherwise there is no point in creating a machine), "the degree of productivity the machine possesses does not depend on the difference between its own value and the value of the tool it replaces" (p. 514).

# APRIL 5 - CHAPTER 16 - ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE SURPLUS VALUE 

The chapter starts to conceptually articulate the discussions from the previous chapters, getting to draw theoretical conclusions for the first volume; starting from the most direct definitions of absolute and relative surplus value (p. 645): "the prolongation of the working day beyond the point at which the worker would have produced an exact equivalent for the value of his labour-power, and the appropriation of that surplus labour by capital - this is the process which constitutes the production of absolute surplus-value. it forms the general foundation of the capitalist system and the starting point for the production of absolute surplus-value".

In this discussion of surplus value, Marx brings up an important concept of capitalist productivity (the second paragraph on p. 644 is a gem) - "the concept of a productive worker, therefore, implies not merely a relation between the activity of work and its useful effect, between the worker and the product of his work, but also a specifically social relation of production, a relation with a historical origin which stamps the worker as capital's direct means of valorization". Your work has to produce surplus value, meaning that you have to produce surplus value to live - so you cannot live without being exploited! The subjugation of labour under the capital! Nowadays the notion of unproductivity implies idleness or laziness, but in fact, in a capitalist society, it is essentially a misfortune - only the market decides what productivity is, perceiving the notion of productivity from classical political economy theories (i.e. Adam Smith) through a reduced capitalist vision. Machines dominate the bodies, and the capitalist is in control of the labor process - even the framework of space and time is now used to orient these subsumptions of capital. 

# APRIL 5 - CHAPTER 23 - SIMPLE REPRODUCTION

The book gets to its apex in this chapter, as Marx starts to unfold the capitalist production as a diachronic process, something that develops in time. The chase for surplus value expands to different sectors, temporalities, and paces; the synchronous view of capital is an essence of production, and the diachronic view of capital is an essence of reproduction. So what are the main tendencies that spring out of this process of capital reproduction?

Here Marx goes back to his diachronic methods, not looking for static analysis but looking for processual and movement over human history (just like with the concept of value in the previous chapter). In the discourse of surplus value transformation, capitalists do not productively consume their surplus value, on the opposite, they spend money on luxury and private property. 

So, labor fund, the concept which Marx brings in this chapter, turns into variable capital. We know that capitalism perceives the wage relation diachronically - the capitalist buys labor power, but pays for it only when the valorization process is complete, i.e. only after the necessary surplus goes into the capitalist's pocket - "worker constantly reproduces his own labour-fund, which never, in his case, takes the form of a money payment for his labour, advanced by another person; but in return, his unpaid and forced labour for the lord never acquires the character of voluntary and paid labour" (p. 713). Variable capital is produced by the worker, but they get back in the form of wages (i.e. paychecks) - just like in Locke's concept of private property, workers in a way own the variable capital. In a way - there is a mediation in the form of a capitalist, on which the workers are dependent to get their wages, while they produce constant capital along with variable capital. Labour transfers value from the capital into the product, and reinvestment of capital come into surplus value being produced. Every production process is consumed and replaced by the capital from the surplus value. In capitalism, the product of your work engrosses the capital that you don't own, and the constant capital - warehouses, machines, etc - is accumulated by the capital, but it is not owned by the producers of the initial capital - the workers. "the worker himself constantly produces objective wealth, in the form of capital, an alien power that dominates and exploits him; and the capitalist just as constantly produces labour-power, in the form of a subjective source of wealth which is abstract, exists merely in the physical body of the worker, and is separated from its means of objectification and realization; in short, the capitalist produces the worker as a wage-labourer" (p. 716) The workers are alienated through the production of means of their own domination, while the capital as a social relation between the worker and capitalist being reproduced. "Capitalist production therefore reproduces in the course of its own process the separation between labour-power and the conditions of labour. It thereby reproduces and perpetuates the conditions under which the worker is exploited. It incessantly forces him to sell his labour-power in order to live, and enables the capitalist to purchase labour-power in order that he may enrich himself" (p. 723). So, in many ways, capital for Marx is also a social relation.

# APRIL 5 - CHAPTER 24 - THE TRANSFORMATION OF SURPLUS-VALUE INTO CAPITAL

The chapter now looks at reproduction on a larger scale - extended reproduction, or constant expansion of the domain of capital. The capitalist consumes only the part of surplus value, reinvests the rest, and starts production again, ending up getting an even higher surplus value. Reproduction of capitalism in time is a growth of capital and growth of population -  "a part of the annual surplus labor must have been applied to the production of additional means of production and subsistence, over and above the quantity of these things required to replace the capital advanced. in a word, surplus-value can be transformed into capital only because the surplus product, whose value it is, already comprises the material components of a new quantity of capital" (p. 727). The accumulation of capital is a spiral.

p. 730-734 gives a summary of the theory of exploitation - if you understand these 4 pages, then you understood the previous chapters well.

Marx points out that the error of political economy is to say that all of the surplus value is reinvested in variable capital - this is not the case, because it is reinvested both in variable and constant capital. Abstinence theory from Section 3 explains further capitalist growth and development through a set of specific bourgeois ethics or bourgeois virtues that define the capitalist lore. These ethics are based on the idea that capitalist entrepreneurs are abstinent and don't consume, so they can reinvest. But essentially, it is a Faustian conflict - asceticism on one end (so the capitalist can reinvest the capital), and hedonism on another (luxury and private property - with capitalist development, the wealth gets to get displayed unapologetically). In modern days, capitalism can both get materialistic pleasure and reinvest the capital at the same time, as it's connected with normal levels of wealth in society. But, after all, it is all exploitation - 
capitalists weirdly find virtue in not consuming *everything* they exploited people for". And the capital is elastic in the way it expands and in the way, it incorporates the society under it. "It has been shown in the course of this inquiry that capital is not a fixed magnitude, but a part of social wealth which is elastic, and constantly fluctuates with the division of surplus-value into revenue and additional capital. It has been seen further that, even with a given magnitude of functioning capital, the labour-power, science, and land (which means, economically speaking, all the objects of labour furnished by nature without human intervention) incorporated in it form elastic powers of capital, allowing it, within certain limits, a field of action independent of its own magnitude" (p. 758) 

# APRIL 5 - CHAPTER 25 - THE GENERAL LAW OF CAPITALIST ACCUMULATION

Another theoretical apex of the book. Marx elaborates on the fact that even raising wages reinforces capital, despite it seems counterintuitive at first. The workers' empowerment does not come from raising the wages; if you have accumulation, then you have more means of production and therefore more means of power - "accumulation of capital is, therefore, multiplication of the proletariat" (p. 764)

If the composition of capital stays the same, then this will lead to a demand for labor. More workers do not mean increased power of the working class, though. While better wages are a reduction of unpaid labor, they still do not eradicate unpaid labor - the system is still there. "Instead of becoming more intensive with the growth of capital, this relation of dependence only becomes more extensive, i.e. the sphere of capital's exploitation and domination merely extends with its own dimensions and the number of people subjected to it" (p. 768) Supply and demand tension on the worker, but the wages can't raise endlessly and demand for the labor will eventually drop. Accumulation level undirectly determines wage level, meaning the level of wages always serves as a function of increased accumulation. Here the wages are a dependent variable - they follow fluctuations of accumulation but not vice versa. So accumulation remains intact and protected - "the relation between capital, accumulation and the rate of wages is nothing other than the relation between the unpaid labor which has been transformed into capital and the additional paid labor necessary to set in motion this additional capital" (p. 771).

The law of progressive growth determines the growth of this ratio, as the capital now needs fewer and fewer workers to activate these means of production, and the most powerful level of accumulation in capitalism is increased productivity of labor. In other words, more capital is invested into labor-saving technology, into constant or variable capital. Variable capital is increased in absolute terms (more workers - more labor power), and even if it falls relative to the constant capital, the increase is still happening in absolute terms. While the ratio of constant capital to variable capital doesn't stay the same, it still creates more and more jobs. The more accumulation is there, the more constant capital grows over variable capital; machines and materials still require wage labor.

The end of section 2 introduces an important distinction between concentration of capital and centralization of capital. While concentration is simple reinvestment of the capital to make it grow (each new accumulation on a larger scale makes the capital expand), centralization of capital is more of a social phenomenon observed in monopolies, gentrification, and the extinction of small businesses. Centralization is the main multiplier of accumulation and favors accumulation even more than concentration. "Centralization supplements the work of accumulation by enabling industrial capitalists to extend the scale of their operations" (p. 779). Especially with the spread of the credit system, which allows the capitalist to borrow to buy without the need for previous accumulation. 

In Section 3, Marx explores how capitalist growth creates a redundant surplus value; and then when the accumulation is boosted (more workers and more jobs), the workers are replaced by machines. While the accumulation of capital creates a surplus, it's impossible to achieve full employment in the capitalist economy. Every increase in productivity level creates overpopulation, while the population grows faster than the accumulation of the capital. Therefore, poverty has nothing to do with overpopulation (see T. R. Malthus) - overpopulation is not the cause of poverty, because capitalism is the cause of overpopulation in the first place, as people's access to means of life depends on their employment and place in the system. Dialectically speaking, capitalism produces a great amount of wealth, but also a great amount of poverty. You cannot disentangle the accumulation of wealth from production and poverty - stagnant parts of industrialism. They go together on a local level and global level, and behind every Silicon Valley, there is a sweatshop somewhere in India.
