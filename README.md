# JAN 26 - CHAPTER 1 - THE COMMODITY

PREFACE: Individuals in the economic society are bearers of socio-economic categories; behavior that economic structure rewards are required for it to function, and the individual is the creator and subject of relations.

COMMODITY:
- satisfies the human need of some sort (doesn't need to be basic);
- embodies human labor;
- commodities exist in a network of exchange;
- basic elementary block of capitalism;
- not meant to be utilized by the producer of it, expressively meant to be exchanged.

USE-VALUE:
- satisfies some human need, qualitative, embodied in its physical being;
- a key building block of wealth (differentiated from value);
- inherently qualitative;
- doesn't have to be mediated by labor.

EXCHANGE-VALUE:
- the quantitive relation that one use-value exchanges for another;
- not inherent in commodities, external to it, and appears when commodities are compared;
- makes commodities equal, or comparable;
- bond to time and place "accidental";
- the language of commodities;
- an external expression of the labor in commodities;
- a form of appearance, hidden and doesn't show its face;
- requires commensurability
- commensurability comes from the common grand of labor in the abstract.

VALUE:
- socially necessary labor time embodied in the commodity;
- dynamic, based on social conditions of production in a given matter;
- more labor -> greater value;
- commodities that can be produced in the same amount of time have the same value;
- there can be use-values that are not values!

VALUE-FORM:
- value makes appearance when A/s only compared with other commodities;
- the Equitas show how value is immaterial, but objective;
- only in the exchange relation does the exchange value exist;
- the logical origin of the money form

In capitalism, use-values are produced for exchange-subordinates use-value.

Dual characteristic of labor:
1. CONCRETE LABOR
- useful labor
- qualitative
2. ABSTRACT LABOR
- abstracted from useful, qualitative aspects of labor;
- equal exchange values are the product of equal labor time.

WEALTH vs. VALUE:
- Wealth: the amount of use-value; useful labor produces wealth.
- Value: connected to abstract labor time; abstracted labor.

RELATIVE VALUE - the value of what is expressed as a commodity.
EQUIVALENT VALUE - the commodity compared to the relative value to provide the exchange value of the relative value. 
- only in equivalence is exchange value apparent and disappears without equivalent;
- the value comes out as commodities are compared with one another;
- Marx calls it a language, a communication mirror;
- build subjectivity through confrontation with other commodities.

MONEY is purely an equivalence.

FETISHISM: 
- a secret that behind the commodity is labor;
- social characteristics of human labor appear as objective aspects of things;
- reification of social relations to commodity relations;
- makes conditions of capitalism appear natural;
- the physical manifestation of labor mediates the appearance of a thing as a commodity;
- the language of commodities is the language of Fetishism.

# FEBRUARY 9 - CHAPTER 2 - THE PROCESS OF EXCHANGE

EXCHANGE:
- not only the economic transactions but social relations;
- there is a social interpretation of Marx as an economic determinist
even though he was accused of being a reductionist, as in his interpretation of economic base (i.e. culture, politics, religion) derives from the material relation which delimits the certain range of the economic base's superstructure. 
- economics relations contain many facets that express themselves on further levels.
- personification of economic categories.

HOT TAKES from Chapter 2:
1. The commodity that is exchanged must bring use value;
2. A commodity must realize its value before its use values;
3. Money necessarily crystallizes from the process of exchange.

Once you develop a universal commodity exchange situation and somehow it becomes out of people's control (hello, capitalism!), then the EXCHANGE-VALUE comes and dominates the USE-VALUE. This determines what you can produce and how you produce it (let's say you want your product to make money on the market - you have to adapt it then); and while such a process can be a sum of many different productions, it still escapes the control of any producer. 

# FEBRUARY 9 - CHAPTER 3 - MONEY, OR THE CIRCULATION OF COMMODITIES

Chapter 3 conveys the theory of money and gives you a glimpse of Marx's larger project. In this chapter, Marx lists different aspects of money in the commodity economy, but for Marx the functions that money plays are not complimentary - they contradict each other, showing that the world of money is inherently contradictory.

PRICE:
- not a material substance, its an abstraction, its a label or notion;
- a language that develops with commodity exchange for commodities to communicate;
- convey meaning and give us information.

MONEY:
- a measure of value, but also a standard of PRICE;
- value is not identical to price, as these concepts are related while not being the same thing; 
- PRICE hides VALUES! 
- and price differs quantitive from value! <- 

^ The two last statements are the most important points from a politically economic perspective.

FUNCTIONS OF MONEY:
1. The measure of values (i.e. money in that function replaces commodity in exchange and represents commodity in the exchange process, assuming the form of commodity);
2. Means of circulation (Marx's concept of metamorphosis: from particular to universal, from commodity to a universal form).


Money constantly creates new needs, so needs are not fixed and accelerated through innovations. The division of labor is an organization of production.

C-M-C (COMMODITY-MONEY-COMMODITY):
- the dynamics of social interaction that emerge from the mechanism of labor and impersonal domination. It creates the dialectics of independence, meaning that we are independent, but also dependent on that system of commodities and money as producers. The necessary logic of commodity exchange gives the drive to the mechanism of power.
- a moment of money is a movement from a particular commodity to universal abstraction - but also a negation of skillful expenses of human power, and useful labor. The economic system negates concrete aspects of human labor, money hides and obscures and conceals the true nature of human labor, hides the vast diversity of human skills, and homogenizes human qualities.
- the fact that money can be exchanged for everything gives the owner unlimited power; someone who has money can validate any activities and lackings.

EXCHANGE develops into CIRCULATION:
- Circulation that process exceeds the agency or control of agents;
- Say's Law is the building block of neoclassical economics - every sale is a purchase, and every purchase is a sale. Therefore, circulation is a balanced stable process between sales and purchases;
- the disconnect between price and value cannot manifest itself (typical crisis of overproduction).

So, how much money should be in circulation, and what determines the quantity of money in the economy? In Marx's terms, we question:

- velocity of money (speed of transactions);
- quantity of commodities in circulation;
- the sum of prices of commodities in circulation (p. 219);
- the sum of payments and debts.

Price determines the quantity of money, not the opposite.

Hoarding money becomes the money of a private person instead of social power (p. 231). The notion of limitless accumulation of money (hoarding drive) is limitless, being a form of accumulation of social power, first time in history based not on military power, but on this abstract notion of money.

The buyer becomes the debtor - they both emerge from commodity circulations; buyer and seller become a power relation - creditor and debtor. 

The concept of a commodity brought by Marx elegantly emerges all these ideas starting with USE-VALUES and wrapping up with debters and creditors.
